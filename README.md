# How to use

Clone this repository on the **MACROPAD**, it's all. 

You can add or remove **MACROPAD** configurations for different applications just by moving files in or out of the **/macros** folder. 

The **boot.py** file disables the serial port and USB flash drive in normal operation. You can re-enable them by holding the top-left key when resetting the device.
